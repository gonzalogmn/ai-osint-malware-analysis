# ai-osint-malware-analysis

Repository to obtain OSINT information about CVEs (Common Vulneratbilities and Exposures) and obtain insights using AI, forecasting future CVEs expected by exploit type.

This repository contains:

- A complete pipeline (executable using `make run` command) with these steps:

  - Read CVE data from official [CVE List](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5.git).
  - Clean input data.
  - Extract exploits related with every CVE using [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/).
  - Try to tag every CVE with an exploit type, using exploit available tags and exploit description.
  - Try to predict CVEs exploit type using [BERT language model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert).

- Then, you can obtain a forecast of CVEs by exploit type using a [notebook](./notebooks/forecast.ipynb). Forecasting is predicted using [Prophet model](https://github.com/facebook/prophet).

You can execute `make help` to see all available commands on this repository.

## Requisites
